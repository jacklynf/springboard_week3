The output is pretty straightforward! When we toggled bit 3, we changed a 1 to a 0, effectively 
subtracting 8 from x. Toggling it again turned the 0 back to a 1, which added 8 back to x. 
When we cleared bit 7 we subtracted 128 from x. Finally, clearing bits 16
to 31 subtracted 26955006476 from the current x value.
